# NCBS-Internship-Project:

Image Segmentation of Cell Membanes using U-net

### Notebook 1: Learning Family of U-nets.ipynb

### Final Notebook: Image Segmentation of Cell Membranes using U-net.ipynb

## About the Internship Objectives:

-> Dataset provided by the Supervisor.

-> Prepare U-net model architecture according to  dataset.

## PROGRESS OF THE INTERNSHIP:

--> First 2 weeks of the Internship mainly focused on learning of the U-net,Data Cleaning from a large chunk of 1.3TB data

--> Internship included intensive learning of machine learning,deep learning modules and the extensive thoughtful implementation of creating         different models,trying different activation functions for tuning the models.
